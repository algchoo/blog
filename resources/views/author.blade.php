I’m Austin Georgiades, a software engineer with a passion for infrastructure and automation. I enjoy video games, cats, camping when it’s shit out, as well as, a variety of other activities.

This blog is meant for me to write and share my learning/experience with others around a variety of technologies and tools. There will be a focus in the DevOps/SRE skill-set.

I hope everyone who reads this has a pretty good day, best wishes to you all.
